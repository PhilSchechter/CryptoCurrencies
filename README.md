# CryptoCurrencies
module 18

## Purpose
There are a lot of crypto-currencies out there. While these are supposed to facilitate transactions, some habe become 
speculative investment vehicles.

In this excercise, I take a (guided) stab at clustering these, using total coins mined and total supply as a basis for grouping.

For multi-dimensional clustering, I look at the coin algorithm and prooftpe as well, but use Principal Component Analyisis (PCA) 
tools to reduce the set to 3 dimensions. This helps focus on more material aspects, and makes graphing easier.

This analysis uses k=-mean analysis and an elbow curve chart to hone in on a good number of clusters to form; the final section of the analysis targets 4 clusters.
